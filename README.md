## Scripts

Useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/` and `~/.local/lib/`. Some worth noting
are:

*   ffn - format filename

ffn turns nasty filename:
```
[AnimeRG] One Piece - {701..730} [720p] [Dual-Audio] [Multi-Sub] [x265] [pseudo].mkv
```
into command line firendly name:
```
animerg_one_piece_701_730_720p_dual_audio_multi_sub_x265_pseudo.mkv
```

ffn also can be used in script to produce sensible filename.
*   ext - extract file
ext let you extract or list archive regardless of file types.
